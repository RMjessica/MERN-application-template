# MERN application template :gear:
This is a simple template for your MERN applications. Feel free to add in whatever else you deem necesary. 

> I've set the client side with `webpack` instead of `create-react-app`.

## Client Side
 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run dev`

Opens up your app in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\


## Server Side
### `npm start`

Starts your backend and opens up your app in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
